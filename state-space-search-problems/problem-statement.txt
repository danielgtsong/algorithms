State Space Search Problems

This challenge is to calculate how to measure 4 liters of water with just two unevenly sized buckets, 
one of 3 liters and another of 5 liters, in minimum number of steps. 
To extend and generalize this, write a program to evaluate the minimum number of steps to measure “X” liters of water, 
with “Y” buckets each having a separate denomination.

Assumptions:

Each bucket used for measuring water should be unique in denomination and the number of buckets will be <= 3
The target amount to be reached has to finally reside in a single bucket (at the end of the measuring activity).
The bucket capacities and target amount will be <= 99
If there are multiple ways to measure the same amount, only one single way, having the minimum number of steps is required.
Ties will be broken by the smallest program.

Examples:

2, 4 , 6, 5

2,3,5,4
Implies that there are 2 buckets of capacity 3 liters and 5 liters each and the target amount desired is 4 liters.

3,4,6,9,7
Implies that there are 3 buckets of capacity 4 liters, 6 liters and 9 liters each and the target amount desired is 7 liters.

Answers:

2 buckets, 3 liter bucket, 5 liter bucket, 4 liters desired
Fill 5 liter bucket to capacity
Move 5 liter bucket to 3 liter bucket 
Empty 3 liter bucket
Move 5 liter bucket to 3 liter bucket
Fill 5 liter bucket
Move 5 liter bucket to 3 liter bucket

3,4,6,9,7
Fill 4
Move 4 to 6
Fill 9
Move 9 to 6
