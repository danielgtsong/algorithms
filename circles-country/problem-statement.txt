Problem Statement
    	Circles Country is a country that contains several circular-shaped districts. Some districts may be situated inside other districts, but their borders do not intersect or touch. Qatam is a resident of Circles Country. When he travels between two locations, he always tries to cross the fewest number of district borders as possible because crossing borders is usually a laborious task. 



Imagine Circles Country as an infinite plane. You are given int[]s X, Y and R, where (X[i], Y[i]) are the coordinates of the i-th district's center and R[i] is its radius. Qatam is currently at point (x1,y1) and he needs to get to point (x2,y2). Neither of these points lies on a district border. Return the minimal number of district borders he must cross to get to his destination.
